[Part I]

[Verse 1]
Ever since I was a small boy
No one else compared to you, no way
I always thought heroes stay close
Whenever troubled times arose

[Chorus]
I didn't know
Ain't always how it goes

[Verse 2]
Every single word you told me
I believed without a question, always
To save all of us, you told us both to trust
But now I know you only saved yourself

[Chorus]
Did you think I'd never know?
Never wise up as I grow

[Bridge]
And you could store an ocean in the holes
In any of the explanations that you gave
And while you still had time, you had a chance
But you decided to take all of your sorrys to the grave

[Chorus]
Did you think I'd never know?
Never wise up as I grow
Did you hope I'd never doubt?
Never wonder, work it out?

[Part II]

[Verse 3]
You were runnin' for cover
Doin' like any other
Fallin' out with a lover
You didn't know that I'd suffer
What a thing to discover
There was time to recover
Move on with each other
Just a boy and a father
What I'd give for another

[Verse 4]
Everything that I have
Couldn't need this for long
Never speak of the time
That you left us alone
Me and Steve on our own
I wanna tell you 'bout the time
I wanna tell you 'bout my life
Wanna play you all my songs
Learn the words, sing along

[Outro]
(This time) Wanna tell you 'bout the time
(I know) I was in Abbey Road
Or the time that I had
Mick Jagger on the phone
I thought of you when we spoke
Wanna tell you 'bout the time
Wanna tell you 'bout my life
Wanna play you all my songs
Hear your voice sing along
I wanna say it's all right
You're just a man after all
And I know you have demons
I got some of my own
Think you passed them along
Wanna tell you 'bout the time
Wanna tell you 'bout my life
Wanna play you all my songs
And hear your voice sing along
